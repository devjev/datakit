# Datakit Road Map

## Version 0.2.\*

- **0.2.0**: Refine schema compatibility checks for Table.
- **0.2.0**: ~~Value contract and column contract checks need to be parallel.~~ No performance gain there, needs more work.
- **0.2.0**: Sane parsing of literal values to `datakit::Value` - piggybacking on the JSON syntax.
